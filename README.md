# CapStone Project: Enhancing a Community Library Website

## Project Overview
This project focuses on enhancing the website for the Greenwood Community Library. The main objective is to make the website more engaging and informative for visitors by introducing new features. The project includes the following updates:

- A new Book Reviews section.
- Updates to the Events page to feature upcoming community events.

## Background Scenario
As part of a development team, I was tasked with simulating the roles of two contributors:

1. Morgan - Responsible for adding the "Book Reviews" section.
2. Jamie - Tasked with updating the "Events" page with new community events.

The existing website already contains basic sections like:
- Home
- About Us
- Events
- Contact Us

The enhancements focus on improving user engagement and adding new dynamic content.

## Objectives
The project also serves to provide hands-on practice with Git, GitHub, and version control workflows:

- Practice cloning a repository and working with branches.
- Gain experience in staging, committing, and pushing changes.
- Learn how to create pull requests and resolve potential merge conflicts.

## Setup
1. Create the Repository:

- Name the repository: greenwood-library-website.
- Initialize the repository with a README.md file.
- Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. File Setup:

- Ensure the project has separate files for each web page:
    - home.html
    - about_us.html
    - events.html
    - contact_us.html

- Add basic content to each file.
- Stage, commit, and push these changes to the main branch to simulate the existing codebase.

## Development Workflow
### Morgan's Work: Adding Book Reviews
1. Create a new branch for Morgan:
    - Branch name: add-book-reviews

2. Add a new file for the Book Reviews section:
    - File: book_reviews.html
    - Add random content to simulate book reviews.

3. Stage, commit, and push changes:
    - Commit message: "Add book reviews section"

4. Create a pull request (PR):
    - Push the add-book-reviews branch to GitHub.
    - Raise a PR for Morgan's work and merge it into the main branch.

### Jamie's Work: Updating the Events Page
1. Create a new branch for Jamie:
    - Branch name: update-events

2. Update the Events page:
    - Modify events.html to include new community events.

3. Stage, commit, and push changes:
    - Commit message: "Update events page with upcoming community events"

4. Create a pull request (PR):
    - Pull the latest changes from the main branch into update-events.
    - Raise a PR for Jamie's work and merge it into the main branch.

## Version Control
The project follows Git best practices:
- Each contributor works on a separate branch.
- Changes are pushed to GitHub, and pull requests are created for review.
- Conflicts, if any, are resolved before merging into the main branch.


## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/greenwood-library-website.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd greenwood-library-website

3. Open the HTML files (e.g., home.html, book_reviews.html, events.html) in your browser to view the content.
